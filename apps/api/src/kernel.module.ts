/**
 * Composition root -- deliberately NOT part of any layer.
 *
 * The onion rule is "dependencies point inward", but something has to wire ports to
 * implementations. That is the composition root. Importing both `infrastructure` and
 * `interface` here is legitimate, because this is not business code -- it is assembly
 * instructions.
 *
 * This is the only exemption from the layering rule, which is why it is EXPLICITLY
 * registered in the `COMPOSITION_ROOT` allowlist in `lint-arch-deps.mjs`, and that
 * allowlist holds exactly two files. Without registration, `src/` root would become a
 * backdoor around the layering check: "put the code in a directory with no layer name"
 * would evade the gate, and nothing would report it.
