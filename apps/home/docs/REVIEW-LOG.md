# apps/home — iteration log

Ten rounds. Each round: find ten concrete gaps in usability, professionalism,
content or accessibility, fix them, re-verify with real browser captures.

Verification harness lives outside the repo (scratchpad) and drives headless
Chromium against `python3 -m http.server`. Layout captures run with
`reducedMotion: 'reduce'` so every reveal has landed — a capture mid-transition
shows a blank section and lies about the layout. A separate `MOTION=on` pass
exercises the animated path.

## Round 1 — baseline build

The page did not exist in source form: `apps/home` on the author's machine held
only `dist/` and `node_modules`, and nothing had ever been committed. This round
is the rebuild plus the first review pass over it.

| # | Gap | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | Fonts loaded from the Google CDN — a third-party request on every visit, invisible text when the CDN is slow or blocked, and visitor IPs handed to a font host. | Self-hosted Outfit + Inter as variable woff2. Google serves one variable file per family+subset but declares it three times; deduplicating cut 592 KB to 184 KB. `preload` on the two latin files. |
| 2 | CJK inherited the latin `-0.04em` tracking, which collides Chinese glyphs, and the 1.6 body leading is too tight for Hanzi. | `:lang(zh)` overrides tracking to `-0.01em` and leading to 1.75. |
| 3 | Hero headline at `6.25rem` filled the whole first viewport; the chain diagram — the one thing that shows what the product *is* — sat below the fold. | Scale down to `clamp(2.5rem, 6vw, 5rem)`. Chain is now visible on a 1440×900 screen. |
| 4 | Reveals used a 900 ms transition and a `0.08` threshold with a `-12%` bottom margin. A fast scroller outran them and landed on blank sections — confirmed in capture, where whole sections rendered empty. | 620 ms, `threshold: 0`, `-4%` margin, plus an explicit first-paint check so anything already on screen is revealed immediately instead of waiting for a scroll event that may never arrive. |
| 5 | The loop scene reserved `420vh` — 4 789 px of scrolling for one diagram, far out of proportion to the rest of the page. | `300vh`. |
| 6 | Nothing stopped English and Chinese from drifting apart; a missing key would have rendered as a blank element in production. | `scripts/check-i18n.mjs`: fails on keys used but untranslated, translated but unused, or translated to whitespace. Currently green at 149 keys. |
| 7 | Diagram labels are drawn by JS and had no translation path at all — they would have stayed English on the Chinese page. | `diagram-strings.js` holds both languages side by side; diagrams re-render on `langchange`; the same check covers them. |
| 8 | The broken-chain diagram used a 220-unit viewBox with content only in the middle band, and repeated "context lost" four times. | 150-unit box, one centred label. |
| 9 | Diagram boxes at `rgba(255,255,255,.035)` on the dark stage were effectively invisible. | Raised to `.07` fill / `.22` stroke. |
| 10 | Architecture bracket labels were rotated 90°, 11 px and dim — unreadable. | Horizontal, placed in a widened viewBox with room reserved for them. |

Also fixed while verifying: the harness token parked on top of the "Evidence"
gate label under reduced motion, hiding it.
